# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

--Average danceability for each artist
SELECT artist_name, ROUND(AVG(danceability), 2) AS average_danceability
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY AVG(danceability) DESC;

--Longest song released
SELECT artist_name, track_name, MAX(duration_ms) AS song_duration_ms
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata;

--Most popular artists
SELECT artist_name, ROUND(AVG(popularity), 2) AS average_popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY AVG(popularity) DESC;
